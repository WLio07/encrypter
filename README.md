# Little-Projects

encrypter3_2en.py - This program takes an one-paragraph string and converts it  into an unintelligible set of characters. Then, a program will be automatically generated in the Desktop that will have the array of keys to decrypt the code previously created.

threedotscartesianplaneen.py - This program takes the cooordinates of three dots in a cartesian plane and calculates the properties of the geometric figure that was formed.

NumberGuesser.py - This program is a game which will take the chosen min and max of a range and select a random number from it, you have an unlimited amount of tries.

Mediasen.py - This program calculates harmonic, arithmetic, geometric mean, or weighted average.

gradeprobab.py - This program calculates the likelihood of randomly getting x questions right in an exam of y questions of z items each.

PlagiarismDetector.py - This program aims to estimate the likelihood of a set of texts being plagiarized from another given text. It needs the proper weights of its logistic factors in the 'calcula_assinatura(texto)' [calculate_signature(text)] functions. Now that it is translated to english, it will have more features to make it more accurate. Halted as well since it is not in my interest to finish it amid other projects and to-dos.

PrimevalBrowserManipulator.py - This is what I use as an archetypical template in order to make Browser Manipulation scripts (automatize browser tasks, such as sending emails or visiting a website and clicking something every 30 seconds).

ArticleGenerator.py - A program to procedurally generate news articles given some input information. Development currently halted â€” the site recipient of the generator is currently under changes as of November 2019.
